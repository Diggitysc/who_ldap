repoze.who.plugins.ldap Changelog
=================================

Future (20yy-mm-dd)
-------------------------------

 - provide start_tls option both for the authenticator and the metadata provider
 - let the user choose whether to return the full DN or the supplied login as
   the user identifier
 - enable configuration of the naming attribute
 - enable the option to bind to the server with privileged credential before
   doing searches
 - create a new LDAPSearchAuthenticatorPlugin to let the API client get the
   DN from a directory search instead than by pattern-replace. This plugin
   adds the option to set a restrict assertion to the ldap search pattern.

   define the 'login' item in the identity dict.
 - Included the plugin to load metadata about the authenticated user from the
   LDAP server.
 - Documented how to install and use the plugins.
